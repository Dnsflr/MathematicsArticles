# MathematicsArticles
This repository contains a collection of my mathematical research articles, notes, and explorations. Topics span various fields of mathematics, including (but not limited to) algebra, analysis, geometry, number theory, and mathematical logic.

All articles are written in Polish and formatted in LaTeX. Each document reflects ongoing or completed research work or mathematical curiosity.
